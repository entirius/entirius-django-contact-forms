    """TextField that encrypts at rest with Fernet (key derived from SECRET_KEY).

    Cannot be filtered, indexed, or used in aggregate lookups — by design.
    Use plain TextField for searchable values; reserve this for secrets
    (OAuth refresh tokens, API keys, anything that must be encrypted at rest).

    On decryption failure (typically: SECRET_KEY rotated without re-encrypting
    rows, or row corruption), the field returns the empty string and logs the
    failure with the field's model.name. The raw ciphertext is NEVER returned
    — that would silently feed garbage to consumers (e.g. as if it were a real
    OAuth refresh token sent to Google's OAuth endpoint), and a subsequent save
    would double-encrypt the ciphertext into permanently unrecoverable data.

    Empty-string-on-failure means consuming code that does
    ``if not config.oauth_refresh_token: skip`` (the standard pattern in
    ``services/conversions/google_ads_uploader.py``) gracefully degrades.
